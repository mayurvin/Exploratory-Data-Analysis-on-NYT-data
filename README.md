# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Performed EDA on the New York Times and RealDirect data in R in RStudio. First the EDA is done for one day NYT data and only Brooklyn Borough and then extended the analysis for Monthly data and all NYC Boroughs to look for trends and other findings. The NYT and RealDirect data is taken directly from the NYT and RealDirect website in .csv format.
